# Pokédex For Fun

This is a simple Pokédex using PokéAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) I made for a job interview. It's fun so maybe I'll keep building it in the future...

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### use `npm start` 

Use `npm start` to run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
